1.         What is React Js?
ans      React, often referred to as React.js or ReactJS, is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs).
             It was developed and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
             React is widely used for developing web and mobile applications.

              •Key features and concepts of React include:

             •  Component-Based: React is based on a component-based architecture. Developers create UI components, 
               which are reusable, self-contained building blocks that encapsulate a part of the user interface. 
               Components can be composed and nested to build complex interfaces.

              •Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model). 
                    When changes are made to the UI, React updates the virtual DOM first and then efficiently updates the real DOM. 
                    This minimizes the number of manipulations needed on the actual page, leading to better performance.

              •Declarative: React applications are declarative, meaning developers describe the desired state of the UI, 
                and React takes care of updating the UI to match that state. This is in contrast to imperative programming, 
                where developers specify step-by-step how to achieve a result.

              •One-Way Data Flow: React enforces a unidirectional data flow. Data flows down from parent components to child components. 
                 When data changes, it flows in one direction, which makes it easier to understand and debug how data changes affect the UI.

            •Reusability: React promotes component reusability. Components can be reused across different parts of the application, 
               and this reusability reduces duplication and simplifies maintenance.


2.      What is NPM in React Js?
ans   In React.js and web development in general, NPM stands for "Node Package Manager."
          NPM is a package manager for JavaScript and Node.js environments that allows developers to easily manage and share packages
         (libraries, frameworks, and tools) that can be used in their projects. It serves as a central repository for a vast number of open-source JavaScript packages.

         • Here's what NPM is used for in the context of React.js:

          •Package Installation: NPM is used to install packages and dependencies needed for a React project.
            This includes React itself, as well as third-party libraries like React Router for routing, Redux for state management, 
            Axios for making HTTP requests, and many others. Developers can specify these dependencies in a project's package.json file
            and then use NPM to fetch and install them.

        •Version Management: NPM helps manage the versions of packages. It allows developers to specify the desired versions 
          of packages in the package.json file, ensuring that a project uses the same versions of packages across different development
          environments, making it more predictable and maintainable.

        •Dependency Resolution: NPM is responsible for resolving and installing the dependencies of packages.
          When you install a package, NPM also installs the packages it depends on, creating a dependency tree. 
          This helps ensure that all the necessary components are present for your project to work correctly.

3.      What is Role of Node Js in react Js?
ans    Node.js and React.js are both JavaScript technologies, but they serve different purposes and are often 
           used together in web development. Here's a look at the role of Node.js in a React.js project:

          • Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Node.js can be used to implement server-side rendering (SSR) in a React.js application. 
             SSR allows the initial rendering of a web page to happen on the server before sending it to the client. 
            This can improve performance, search engine optimization (SEO), and the user experience. Node.js, with frameworks like Next.js
            or Express, is often chosen for implementing SSR with React.

          •API Server: Node.js is commonly used as the backend server for React applications. It can handle HTTP requests, 
           perform business logic, and communicate with databases and other services. Node.js is well-suited for building 
           RESTful APIs and GraphQL endpoints that a React frontend can interact with to retrieve and update data.

         •Build and Development Tools: Node.js is used to run build and development tools for React projects. 
           For example, tools like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint are often used to bundle, transpile, and lint React code. 
           Node.js is the runtime environment for these tools, making it possible to automate tasks, optimize code, and streamline the development workflow.

       •Package Management: Node.js comes with NPM (Node Package Manager), which is essential for managing 
         dependencies and packages in a React project. React applications often rely on numerous third-party libraries
         and tools, which are installed and managed using NPM.

4.      What is CLI command In React Js?
ans   In React.js, a CLI command (Command Line Interface command) refers to a command that you run in the terminal or 
          command prompt to interact with React-related tools, scripts, and utilities. React developers often use CLI commands 
          to perform various tasks, such as creating new React applications, running development servers, building production 
          bundles, and more. These commands are typically provided by tools like Create React App and other development setups.
          Here are some common CLI commands used in React development:

          • Create a New React Application:
             npx create-react-app my-app: This command initializes a new React application named "my-app" using Create React App. 
             It sets up the project structure and installs the necessary dependencies.

           •Start Development Server:
             npm start or yarn start: This command starts a local development server for your React application. 
              It allows you to see your application in action, automatically reloads when you make changes, and provides helpful error messages.

           •Build for Production:
              npm run build or yarn build: This command generates optimized and minified production-ready build files for
              your React application. The output can be deployed to a web server.



5.     What is Components in React Js?
ans  In React.js, a component is a reusable, self-contained building block for creating user interfaces. Components are
        the fundamental units of a React application and are responsible for rendering a part of the user interface. 
        They can represent anything from a small button or input field to complex sections of a web page or even entire web applications. 
        React promotes a component-based architecture, which allows developers to break down the UI into small, manageable pieces.
       

      • There are two main types of components in React:

      •Functional Components: 
        These are defined as JavaScript functions that return JSX (JavaScript XML) to describe the UI. Functional 
        components are simpler and easier to read and write. They are often used for stateless or presentational components.

        function Welcome(props) {
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
        }

    •Class Components: 
      Class components are defined as ES6 classes and extend the React.Component class. 
      They can manage state, have lifecycle methods, and are often used for more complex, stateful components.


       class Counter extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
        }
     render() {
    return <div>Count: {this.state.count}</div>;
     }
       }



6.     What is Header and Content Components in React Js?
ans  In a React application, "Header" and "Content" components are common terms used to describe two distinct parts of
        a user interface. These components are often used to create a layout or structure for a web page or application, with the
        "Header" component typically containing elements like navigation menus, logos, and headings, while the "Content" component holds the main content of the page.

       Here's a brief explanation of each:
    
      •Header Component:

      Role: The Header component is responsible for rendering the top section of a web page or application. 
                 It usually contains elements that are consistent across multiple pages, such as a navigation bar, site logo, search bar, 
                 user profile, or any other information or controls that you want to display at the top of the page.

    Common Use Cases: Header components are often used for creating consistent and easily navigable user interfaces. 
                                            For example, a website's header might include links to various sections of the site, a search bar, and a user login/logout button


    •Content Component:

    Role: The Content component is responsible for rendering the main content of a web page or application. 
               It is the area where most of the page's unique content is displayed. This content can vary widely depending on the purpose 
              of the page, such as articles, product listings, user profiles, or any other application-specific information.

   Common Use Cases: Content components are versatile and can be used on different pages to display specific content.
                                           For example, on an e-commerce website, the Content component on the homepage might display a list of featured products,
                                           while on the product details page, it might show detailed product information.

8.    How to check version of React Js?
ans To check the version of React.js in your project, you can use one of the following methods:

          1.Check the package.json file:

           •React.js version information is typically stored in your project's package.json file. Open this file 
             in the root directory of your project using a text editor or code editor.

           •Look for a dependency entry named "react" in the "dependencies" or "devDependencies" section. 
             The version number of React.js will be specified next to it.

            •Example:

             "dependencies": {
             "react": "^17.0.2",
              // other dependencies
               }
            In this example, the version of React.js is 17.0.2.

           2.Use the command line:

                •Open your project's root directory in a terminal or command prompt.

                •Run the following command to display the React.js version installed in your project:

                            npm show react version

                  Or if you are using Yarn:

                         yarn info react version

               This will print the installed version of React.js to the terminal.

            3.In your JavaScript code:

                   •You can also check the React.js version programmatically within your JavaScript code by accessing the React.version property.

            •Example:


                   console.log(React.version);

              Add this code to one of your JavaScript files (e.g., an entry point like index.js) and run your application. 
              The React.js version will be logged to the console.

             These methods will help you determine the version of React.js used in your 


9.     How to change in components of React Js?
ans To make changes in components in a React.js application, you need to modify the component's code. 
         Here are the general steps for making changes in React components:

            1.Locate the Component:
               Identify the component you want to change within your React application. Components are 
                typically defined in JavaScript files and organized in your project's directory structure. Find the component file you want to modify.

         2.Open the Component File:
             Use a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to open the component file you want to change. 
             This file will contain the code for your React component.

          3.Make Changes:
              Inside the component file, you can make the necessary changes to the component's code. This might involve:

                • Modifying the component's render method to change the content it renders.
                •Adding new state variables or props.
                •Modifying event handlers and methods.
                •Importing additional modules or components.
                •Adjusting the component's styling (CSS or styles).
